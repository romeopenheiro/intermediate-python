# Intermediate Python (2021-10-15)

The course Intermediate Python on Friday the 15th of October will be taught as an online-only course. It starts at 2 PM so make sure you are connected promptly as teaching will commence on time.

The course will be led through Microsoft Teams at this link. Note that using Teams in a web browser requires Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge; otherwise you can install the app.

The teaching material is available at [Intermediate Python] (https://milliams.com/courses/intermediate_python/)

# Preparation

Make sure that you have Anaconda Python 3 installed and working before the sessions starts (or another way of writing and executing Python scripts).

The instructions for installing Anaconda are available for Linux for Windows and for MacOS.

Ensure that you have gone through the setting up of JuypterLab as in the material so that when we start the session, you're ready to go. There's a video going through this on YouTube. Also, check that you are able to write and run Python scripts as shown in this video.
